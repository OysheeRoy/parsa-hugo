Gastronome and a User Experience Researcher who loves to explore the human factors involved in cooking a dish or in building a product. Born in a bengali family, the love for food began in my early childhood. 

Working at my desk or in my kitchen, my focus has always been on understanding the stories, and the socio, economic and cultural factors behind the choices made.
