Last night I was talking to my friend, Aditi and we were discussing how this social distanting has affected our daily routine specially a few of the things we love. One such is grocery shopping. Its like a retail therapy. I get more excited to walk into a Walmart than into a Sephora. I can spend hours walking around the aisles. Looking into ingreditents and products on the shelves.

I can spend hours going through the aisles, fresh vegetables, herbs. Its like planning the whole meal for weeks. Spices to store.. There are some staples in my kotchen. Other thing  is learning recipes. Look the recipes on prepared sauce and understan the ingredients. Anything pre made count sugar. So that I understand what goes in.. Simple things milk, cheese, basic spices, onion ginger garlic

organizing and meal planning happens in the store.. The vegetables like cauliflower cabbage can stay longer whereas eggplant or spinach should be cooked quicker. I have always found keep a box of mushroom and spinach at hand is comfortable. Its help to cook a quick mushroom omleette or may be a cre;pe with mushroom stuffind or may be a lazy mid week dinner of veg quesdilla. Spinach can also be put in daal. Other thing are eggs. Corriander leaves are very important in indian cooking. But buying a bunch always waste. So usally I chop them and store in aire tight container. So can use it whole. Moving to the frozen section chicken fish shrimp beef or pork and mutton. I think shrimp can complement everything. Stirfry, vegetables, curry, quesdilla. milk,cream , fruits. May be a yogurt smoothie, fruits for breakfast or served with cakes as toppings. Spices turmeric, chilli powder, bay leaf, cumin, corriander, cinnamon cardamom cloves are basic. A little this and other this can make a whole difference. Dry : rice, flour, masoor dal and moong dal.
