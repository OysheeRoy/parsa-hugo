Mutton, be it lamb or goat, has an overpowering smell and has to be simmered on low heat to get the meat fall from the bone. One of my fondest memories of Sunday mutton curry has to be the one where I used to go to the kitchen to get a piece of kosha mangsho and a little jhol. 

Cooking a simple mutton curry happens in three steps-- > 

The first step is to eliminate the meat smell, 

The next step is to get the color and 

The final step is to get the flavor in.

The amount of onion and ginger garlic paste increases with the amount of meat. If you are making a thin curry, use 1 big red onion for 700gm of mutton. Increase the amount of onion if you want a thicker gravy.

The best thing about cooking mutton is that you don't have to thinly slice the onion as it is going to get cooked down to make the delicious thick curry. Although it takes a long time to cook, you can toss things in your pressure cooker or cookpot and just stir at regular intervals.

Recipe:

\-> Start with chopping the onion and making a paste of ginger, garlic, and green chili

\-> Add oil of your choice in the pressure cooker. You can also use a cooking pot, but it will take a longer time. 

\-> Add chopped onion, the ginger garlic paste and cook it till the onion is translucent. Add cleaned meat and salt and stir the curry for some time.

\-> Close the lid of the pressure cooker and let it cook. If you are cooking in a pot, reduce the heat and cover it to boil.

\-> Wait for 3 whistles and then turn off the stove. Once the pressure releases on its own, open the lid and add red chili powder and cumin powder to it. Stir the meat for a minute. You can see the meat has released its juices.  Put the lid back and let the mutton cook in its own juices for another 4 whistles.

\-> This is when you try a little kosha mangsho adjust the curry with salt or spice if required. Finally, add the garam masala and put it on pressure for one last time. Add a little water if needed. 

At this time around, you will know how many more whistles you will need to thoroughly cook the mutton.  Once the final whistle is done, open the lid and check the meat and salt in the curry. Add a dollop of ghee at the end and turn off the heat.

P.S - > I make my own garam masala. Its a blend of cinnamon stick, cardamom (green and black), mace, nutmeg, and bay leaf.
